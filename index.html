 <h1 style="text-align:center"> A Different Kind of Resume </h1> 
<p> <strong> Hi! My name is Rebecca Barshay and I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia.
I have loved being a Dawg this year and am so thankful for all of the opportunities UGA provides
to their students. Many of the clubs and committees at UGA require a resume during their application
process. I have been able to utilize the resume I built earlier this semester, however, its boring
black and white, Times New Roman text is hardly appealing to the eye. I decided to use the Web Page 
Project as a chance to enhance and bring my resume to life through photos, different font style and colors
and other elements. I hope you enjoy it too! </strong>
